The idea of KuberNAS is to create a
### self-hosted k8s (Kubernetes) NAS and application cluster on your own computers

Hi there, I'm looking for collaborators ðŸ‘‹ who have parallel goals and ideas, to help accumulate knowledge, techniques, and scripts for achieving something along these lines.

We want to show easy ways to create highly-available Network Attached Storage, with locally hosted application servers, running on Kubernetes-compatible clusters, using your own computers.

Common use cases, and desired functions:
  - Add new hardware into the k8s cluster with a few clicks
  - Easily self-host databases, documents, and containerized apps (especially those needing high availability and redundancy)
  - Speed up software development CI/CD and testing (sharing locally running apps with testers and automation bots)
  - Low-volume self-hosted services (public tunnelled) 
  - Redirection of higher-traffic spillover to external cloud services
  - Built-in file and database backups, and volume snapshots
  - Integrating with commercial cloud service providers like AWS Azure GCP DigitalOcean etc
  - Extending redundancy of locally-hosted k8s services between clusters you own (e.g. office and home) 

100% self-host your data and services when you desire greater control over
    - data privacy
    - data sovereignty
    - source code integrity
